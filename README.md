# Chartie

## General info
Calculate area under functions in defined range. Can calculate area of following functions:
- `sin(x)`
- `sin(x) / x`
- `x^2`
- `e^-|x|*cos(2*pi*x)`


## Features
- Observe how area calculated on charts
- Set intervals quantity, range, calculation method and function on fly
- Inspect relation between number of intervals and error
- Scalable and movable chart
- Inspect `X` and `Y` values in certain points on chart by pressing key 'Alt' and hovering mouse


## Controls
- Press `Alt` and hover mouse over chart to see x and y value of function in this point
- Press `Space` to center chart at (x,y) = (0, 0)
- Use `Wheel` or `+` and `-` to scale chart. Scale origin at pointer pos
